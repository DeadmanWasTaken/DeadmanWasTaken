### My Opensource Story

Most of my leisure time is to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Acknowledging my extensive contribution to DuckDuckGo's open source projects, I was promoted as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all DuckDuckGo's repositories. I had contributed to Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS, and several other open-source projects and organizations.

I also maintain and contribute to a lot of community open-source projects and libraries. Some of the communities includes [Tinkerhub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org/), [Kites Foundation](https://kitesfoundation.org/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/), [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/) etc. I strongly believe that the true value of open-source is not just the code, it's the community around it.

You can learn more about me and my open source journey at my website: [https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/](https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/)

Most of the open-source projects I create are the solutions to the problems I face in my life, there are even more that are yet unsolved. I am on a journey to find solutions for them, one at a time.
